  <!-- Usually, we recommend customers not to change this, however our Async 
    tests are quite sensitive to timing. We were filling up the threadpool, and 
    then the test was complaining that the timeout didn't fire quickly enough. 
    Liberty would notice that the pool was full and quickly add more threads, 
    but we'd get test failures because the timeout fired a few seconds late. 
    We could increase the size of the timing window instead, but that would make 
    the test run take longer, so instead I'm setting a minimum number of threads. -->
